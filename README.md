This repository contains both the server and client sides.

How to run the program for three clients:

First, open the project in a Java IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
Open the Main.java class and run it (the main method).
Then, once the server is started, run the different player clients main main methods:
Open PlayerClient and run the main method, open PlayerClient_2 and run it, and lastly open PlayerClient_3 and run it.

Each client will be asked to write their names. Once that is done, it will as the first player to write their message.
Once done, the server will update the turn to the second player, and so on.
